In order to code an rtl by using its subblocks we have to understand the internal circuit first and then connect the sublocks with wires here 
while full adder equation is S=A⊕B⊕C
                             Carry Cout=(A⋅B)+(Cin⋅(A⊕B))

HALF ADDER 
S=A⊕B
C=A⋅B

SO to get the full adder with half adder 
we have to connect the two half adders and carry output of 1st half adder and 2nd half adder is connected with or gate to get the carry
